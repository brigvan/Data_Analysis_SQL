# Data Analysis SQL

This is a collection of some real-world projects available on DataCamp that can be carried out using PostgreSql.


## 1 Analyze International Debt Statistics
**Description**: In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank.

**Dataset**:The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. 

**Questions to answer** 
1. What is the number of distinct countries present in the database?
2. What country has the highest amount of debt?
3. What country has the lowest amount of repayments?

## 2 Analyzing Motorcycles Part Sales
**Description**: You're working for a company that sells motorcycle parts, and they've asked for some help in analyzing their sales data!
They operate three warehouses in the area, selling both retail and wholesale. They offer a variety of parts and accept credit cards, cash, and bank transfer as payment methods. However, each payment type incurs a different fee.
The board of directors wants to gain a better understanding of wholesale revenue by product line, and how this varies month-to-month and across warehouses. 

**Dataset**:The database, which contains a table called *sales*, consisting of columns such as the type of product ordered, the amount, the price per product, payment method, date of the order, etc. 

**Questions to answer** 
1.You have been tasked with calculating net revenue for each product line and grouping results by month and warehouse. The results should be filtered so that only "Wholesale" orders are included, for the months of June, July and August




## 3 Analyzing Students' Mental Health
**Description**: A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.
The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression. Explore the students data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.

**Dataset**:The database, which contains a table called *sales*, consisting of columns such as the type of product ordered, the amount, the price per product, payment method, date of the order, etc. 

**Questions to answer** 
1.Explore and analyze the students data to see how the length of stay (stay) impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of the international students present in the study.
